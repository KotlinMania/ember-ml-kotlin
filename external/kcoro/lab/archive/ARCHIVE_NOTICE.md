ARCHIVE: lab/archive/

This directory contains archived experimental and legacy implementations (legacy pthreads, shared-stack context switch experiments, scheduler prototypes and other work-in-progress). These files are retained for historical reference and investigation only.

DO NOT: include or compile these files as part of the default build, or rely on their symbols for production code.

If you need to build or experiment with these files, set `COMPILE_ARCHIVE=1` explicitly and review the README inside each subfolder for instructions.

Expect these files to be pruned or moved to a separate archival repository in future cleanup work.

Broken Scheduler Prototype (Archived)

Status
- Backup snapshot of a failed scheduler integration attempt.
- Not referenced by any build or test.

Contents
- kc_sched_broken.c — prototype with experimental coroutine integration that was not merged.

Rationale for Archiving
- Kept for historical context only. The production scheduler lives in
  `coroutines/kcoro/user/src/kc_sched.c` and is validated by tests.

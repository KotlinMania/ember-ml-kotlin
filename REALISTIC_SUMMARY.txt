================================================================================
REALISTIC SESSION SUMMARY - What Actually Works
================================================================================

PRODUCTION READY (Tested & C-Validated):
-----------------------------------------
✅ CFloat16 (26 tests passing, C-validated bit-exact)
✅ CFloat32 (from llama.kotlin, proven)
✅ CFloat64 (8 tests passing, C-validated conversions)
✅ CFloat128 Double-Double (19 tests passing, C-validated, 2× precision proven)
✅ SWAR/HPC infrastructure (ported, compiles cleanly)
✅ KLang cross-platform bitwise ops

Total: 53/53 tests passing, ~5,400 lines production code

IN PROGRESS (Compiles, Not Validated):
---------------------------------------
🚧 HPC16x9 (332 lines) - 144-bit with overflow room
🚧 Float128Math (398 lines) - IEEE-754 binary128 skeleton
   - Pack/unpack: ✅ Done
   - Special values: ✅ Done
   - Conversions: ✅ Done
   - Addition: ❌ Stubbed
   - Multiplication: ❌ Stubbed
   - Division: ❌ Stubbed
   - SWAR optimization: ❌ Not started
   - Tests: ❌ Not created
   - C validation: ❌ Can't do on macOS (no quadmath)

Total: ~1,000 lines unvalidated code

REALITY CHECK:
--------------
- macOS ARM64 has NO __float128 support (no quadmath.h)
- long double = 8 bytes = same as double (53-bit mantissa)
- Can't validate true Float128 against C on this platform
- Would need Linux + GCC + quadmath for validation

THE GOOD NEWS:
--------------
Our double-double CFloat128 is EXCELLENT:
- Bit-exact validated against C
- Proven 2× more precise than double
- All tests passing
- Better than NumPy's "float128" (which is 80-bit on x86, 64-bit on Windows)
- Production ready NOW

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Option 1: Ship double-double CFloat128 as-is (READY NOW)
Option 2: Finish Float128Math + validate on Linux (2-4 hours + Docker setup)
Option 3: Ship double-double, add Float128Math as experimental

STATUS: We have a rock-solid float type system. The true IEEE-754 binary128 
is a good foundation but needs finishing + proper validation.

No overpromising. No pretending unvalidated code is tested.
